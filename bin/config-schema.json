The variable name has to be [sessionId (default = 'session) in all caps]_DATA_JSON. You have to make sure to surround your session data with single quotes to maintain the formatting.\n\nFor example:\n\nsessionId = 'session'\n\nTo set env var:\n```bash\n    export SESSION_DATA_JSON=`...`\n```\nwhere ... is copied from session.data.json this will be a string most likley starting in `ey...` and ending with `==`\n\nSetting the sessionData in the environmental variable will override the sessionData object in the config.","type":"string","key":"sessionData"},{"env":"WA_BROWSER_WS_ENDPOINT","p":"browser-ws-endpoint","type":"string","description":"ALPHA EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE!
